<h4>How can I copy data to the Virtual Machine ?</h4>

<ol>
<li>Copy your file content to the OS clipboard using your favorite
text editor.
<li>Paste the data to the JS/Linux clipboard using the mouse (it is
the text area on the right of the VM terminal).
<li>In the VM Linux shell do:
<pre>
cat < /dev/clipboard > /tmp/myfile
</pre>
Your text file is now copied to <tt>/tmp/myfile</tt>.
</ol>

To copy binary data, you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuencoding"><tt>uuencode</tt></a> it on the PC using (assuming you use Linux): 
<pre>
uuencode myfile myfile > myfile.txt
</pre>
Then you copy <tt>myfile.txt</tt> to the Linux VM and uudecode it by doing:
<pre>
uudecode < /dev/clipboard
</pre>

<h4>How can I copy data from the Virtual Machine ?</h4>

The procedure is the reverse of the previous one:
<ol>
<li>Copy your file to the clipboard:
<pre>
cat myfile > /dev/clipboard
</pre>
<li>Select all the clipboard data and copy it to the host OS clipboard
using the mouse over the text area on the right of the VM terminal.
<li>Paste the data in your favorite text editor
</ol>

For binary files, you can <tt>uuencode</tt> in the VM
and <tt>uudecode</tt> on the host.

<h4>When will there be network support ?</h4>

It is relatively easy to add a virtual network interface. The problem
is to make it communicate with other hosts, so at this point it is
not my priority. For example, due to security restrictions, it is only
possible to communicate with the web site hosting the VM or with
cooperating servers. Moreover, only specific types of network
protocols can be handled because no raw TCP connection nor raw UDP
packets can be sent due to API restrictions and security reasons.


<h4>Is it possible to emulate a VGA card and all the missing devices
to launch say FreeDOS or Windows ?</h4>

Yes, it is possible but since the current VM is quite slow, only old
OSes (such as Windows 3 or MSDOS) would be really usable. 

<h4>Will you release some source code ?</h4>
Yes, at least of the tools and source code necessary to try your own OS
and make your own experiments.

<h4>Is my privacy respected ?</h4>
Yes. What you type in the Virtual Machine stays in your browser. No
data is sent back to the server.
